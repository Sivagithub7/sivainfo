															DBMS:
=============================================================================================================================
DATA: Data is a rawfact(I.E char's.numbers,special char's,symbols etc..)
-->It never gives menaningfull statements.

EX: SMITH    1086
    WARD     7575
   
INFORMATION: Processing data
>>It gives meaningfull statements.

EX: CUSTOMER    CUS_ID
	--------	------
	Smith 		25826
	Miller		7637
	
DATABASE: It is a memory
>>Collection of interrelated data/infoemation

EX: BANK_SBI
				BRANCHES
							DEPT
							        EMP
									      CUSTOMER
														ACOUNTS/LOANS
											
TYPES OF DATABASE: 
1) OLTP(ONLINE TRANSISSION PROCESSING)
2) OLAP(ONLINE ANALITICAL PROCESSING)

(1)OLTP: Storing the "day to day" transitional information(live operations are :insert,update ,delete,select)
EX: Oracle,Server sql,Mysql,Db2
SBI BANK:--x-customer--network--open on 25june2024(on receipt)

(2)OLAP: Storing historical (big data) data/ inforation
Select(retrival/read)operation only.
EX: Dataware house

DATA STORAGES: >Papers & books(before computers)
			   >Flatfiles(from computers)
			   >DBMS(software)
2)FLATFILES:
>>Data redundancy: When a name and address are both present in different columns within a table(multiple copies of same data).
>>Data inconsistancy: Condition that occurs b/w tables when similar data is kept in different formats in two diff tables.
>>Data retrieval: WHICH IS VERY COMPLEX WHILE RETRIEVING DATA FROM FILES WHICH WAS ADDRESSED WITH HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE.
--WHERE AS IF YOU WANT TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM DATABASE THEN WE ARE USING SQL LANGUAGE.
>>Data integrity: concept and process that ensures the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and validity of an organizations data.
>>Data security: DATA IS NEVER SECURE UNDER BOOKS AND FLAT FILE WHERE AS DATABASEARE PROVIDING AN EXCELLENT CONCEPT IS CALLED AS
ROLE BASED SECURITY MECHANISM FOR ACCESSING DATA FROM DATABASE WITH SECURITY MANNER WITH THE HELP OF AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
>>Data indexing: INDEXES ARE USING FOR ACCESSING DATA MUCH MORE FASTER BUTFLAT FILES DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY INDEX MECHANISM WHERE AS 
DATABASE WILL PROVIDE INDEXING MECHANISM.

DBMS: It is a software which is used to maintain & manage data/information in database memory.
--By using DBMS s/w we can:
>>Creating database memory
>>Creating Tables
>>Inserting data
>>Updating data
>>Selecting data
>>Deleting data

Models of DBMS: 
>>Hierarchial DBMS (outdated)
>>Network DBMS (outdated)
>>Relational DBMS

>>Relational DBMS:
1)ORDBMS(Object Relational DBMS)
2)OODBMS(Object Oriented DBMS)

				ORDBMS  									  OODBMS
											  
1)It depends on SQL								1) It depends on OOPs concept			  
2)Data can be stored in table format			2)Data can store in form of objects.								  
	table=Collection of rows/colums										  
	row=Group of columns					  
EX: Oracle,Sql server,DB2						EX: Mongodb,Cassandra etc..
